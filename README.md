The main topic of this issue is not to demonstrate if the Oktoberfest is popular or if many people travel there, but to prove that terrorism & weather impact beer consumption. 

After extracting, transforming and loading this information into Tableau I've crossed this information in order to demonstrate that there is relation between that information. 

After doing some comparissions I got this curious conclusions:

- In 2016 Germany has 4 terrorist attacks. During that year the consumption of beer has reduced in comparison to 2015 from 75.134 hectolitres to 66.231 (-12%)

- In 2017 and 2019 Germany has 2 terrorist attacks respectively, however the beer consumption during those years did not change. 

- The year that the beer consumption has it peak was not the year that were no terrorist attacks or the year that the highest temperature was registered. 

- Even if there is only one year where the temperature doesn’t affect the beer consumption(2014), we can observe that the beer consumption has always increased when the temperature was higher: 

2001 (9º) =  48.698   ↗ 2002(9.4º)= 57.614

2004 (8.9º) = 61.163 ↗ 2005(9.4º) = 61.772

2006 (9.2º) = 68.617 ↗ 2007(9.8º) = 69.406

2010(8.3º) = 71.000 ↗ 2011 (9.7º) = 79.225
